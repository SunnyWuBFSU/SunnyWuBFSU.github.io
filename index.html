												<h2>Introduction</h2>
											</header>
											<p>Feminism, the belief in social, economic, and political equality of the sexes. Although largely originating in the West, feminism is manifested worldwide and is represented by various institutions committed to activity on behalf of women’s rights and interests.<br>
												Throughout most of Western history, women were confined to the domestic sphere, 
												while public life was reserved for men. In medieval Europe, women were denied the right to own property, 
												to study, or to participate in public life. At the end of the 19th century in France, 
												they were still compelled to cover their heads in public, and, in parts of Germany, 
												a husband still had the right to sell his wife. Even as late as the early 20th century, 
												women could neither vote nor hold elective office in Europe and in 
												most of the United States (where several territories and states granted
												women’s suffrage long before the federal government did so). 
												Women were prevented from conducting business without a male representative, 
												be it father, brother, husband, legal agent, or even son. Married women could not 
												exercise control over their own children without the permission of their husbands. 
												Moreover, women had little or no access to education and were barred from most professions. 
												In some parts of the world, such restrictions on women continue today. (source: Encyclopaedia Britannica)
